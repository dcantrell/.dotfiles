# define the server-side block to use, in our case the IMAPAccount.  Near
# is the local side, so we use our MaildirStore.  Patterns controls what is
# involved in the sync.  'Create Both' means automatically create missing
# mailboxes on the server and local side.  'Remove Both' means propagate
# mailbox deletions between both the server and client sides.  'Expunge Both'
# means propagate mailbox deletions in both directions.  The SyncState and
# Sync options control the sync state file and what to sync, which is
# everything.

# For an initial sync, I set pipeline depth to 1, otherwise gmail will
