Email Configuration:
--------------------

Using mbsync, msmtp, and mutt for email.  The configuration files for those
programs are stored in this repo.  All are configured to use passwords stored
in pass(1), which needs to be set up separately.  pass(1) uses GnuPG so those
are more or less paired.
